# Tokenminning Examples

Tokenminning is best understood through practical examples.

The goal is not to use fewer tokens or build smaller systems.

The goal is to maximize **intelligence per token** by improving the quality, timing, and structure of information presented to AI systems.

Tokenminning focuses on the model's context surface: what information reaches the model, when it reaches the model, and how it is organized.

## Example 1: AI Coding Assistant Context

### tokenmaxxing

- Provide the entire repository as context regardless of task relevance
- Include a 500-line `CLAUDE.md` containing every project detail
- Enable every MCP server without considering task requirements
- Preserve complete chat history instead of extracting decisions

### tokenminning

- Retrieve only relevant files
- Keep `CLAUDE.md` focused on durable guidance
- Enable only task-relevant MCP tools
- Preserve decisions rather than transcripts

Both aim to improve model performance.

The difference is whether optimization comes from **more context** or **better context**.

## Example 2: Knowledge Management

### tokenmaxxing

- Store every conversation
- Duplicate documentation everywhere
- Keep complete historical records in context
- Load entire knowledge bases upfront

### tokenminning

- Separate durable knowledge from temporary information
- Store decisions, constraints, and outcomes
- Use references and retrieval instead of duplication
- Load information only when relevant

**Principle:** Preserve knowledge, not noise.

## Example 3: RAG Systems

### tokenmaxxing

- Retrieve dozens of documents
- Send all results to the model
- Assume more context produces better answers

### tokenminning

- Retrieve candidate information
- Rank for relevance
- Provide only the highest-value information
- Preserve diversity when needed

**Principle:** Better retrieval beats larger retrieval.

---

## Example 4: Agent Workflows

### tokenmaxxing

A planner, coder, reviewer, and tester all receive:

- Entire repository regardless of task relevance
- Full conversation history
- All available tools regardless of task needs

### tokenminning

Each agent receives only what it needs:

- Planner → requirements and constraints
- Coder → relevant files and implementation details
- Reviewer → code changes and acceptance criteria
- Tester → expected behavior

**Principle:** Context should match the task.

---

## Example 5: Memory Systems

### tokenmaxxing

Remember everything:

- Full conversations
- Temporary experiments
- Debugging history
- Intermediate thoughts

### tokenminning

Remember:

- Decisions
- Preferences
- Constraints
- Important outcomes

Discard:

- Temporary work
- Repeated information
- Resolved problems

**Principle:** Memory should preserve signal, not accumulate history.

---

## Example 6: MCP and Tool Usage

### tokenmaxxing

- Install every available integration
- Keep every tool enabled
- Provide maximum capability by default

### tokenminning

- Enable tools intentionally
- Load capabilities when needed
- Remove unused integrations

**Principle:** Every capability introduces cognitive and contextual tradeoffs.

The goal is not fewer tools.

The goal is making the right capabilities available for the task.

---

## Example 7: System Complexity vs Context Complexity

### tokenmaxxing mistake

Assume:

Then remove useful capabilities simply to reduce complexity.

### tokenminning

Recognize that a sophisticated system can still be tokenminning if:

- Information is retrieved selectively
- Tools are scoped appropriately
- Documentation is modular
- The model receives only relevant context

The question is not:

> "How large is the system?"

The question is:

> "What information reaches the model for this task?"

**Principle:** Optimize the context surface, not the size of the system.

Tokenminning is not about making AI systems smaller.

It is about making them smarter about what they expose to the model.
